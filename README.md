# K-Means Clustering Algorithm
This program implements the K-means clustering algorithm using OpenMP APIs. The K-means algorithm is a popular method of vector quantization that aims to partition n observations into k clusters. Each observation is assigned to the cluster with the nearest mean, serving as a prototype of the cluster.
